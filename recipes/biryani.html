Season with 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper. Let the chicken marinate for at least 30 minutes or overnight.</li>
                <li>In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the ghee or oil over medium heat. Add the cinnamon sticks, cardamom pods, cloves, and cumin seeds and stir for 30 seconds until fragrant.</li>
                <li>Add the remaining chopped onion and saut√© for 5 minutes until translucent.</li>
                <li>Add the remaining minced garlic and grated ginger and stir for 1 minute until fragrant.</li>
                <li>Add the coriander powder, turmeric powder, garam masala, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper and stir for 30 seconds until the spices are well combined.</li>
